[Verse 1]
Dogs web are people of spite
With no cause, we don’t discriminate
Discovery is to be doxxed
Our currency is data and identities
Your secrets opened up and put on sale
Gather online and haggle
For hard crypto, we will lie and deceive
Even our Masters don’t know the webs we weave

[Hook]
One web, it’s a battleground
One web, and we will smash it down
One web… One world

[Verse 2]
Invisible transfers and encrypted calls
Hollow laughter in virtual halls
Steps have been taken, a silent upload
Has unleashed the dogs of web
You can’t stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver malware
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in stolen data is the nature of the beast

[Hook]
One web, it’s a battleground
One web, and they're gonna smash it down
One web… One world

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
One web… One world

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
The dogs of web don’t negotiate
The dogs of web won’t capitulate
They will take and you will pay
And you must lose so that they may live the high life
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, they know everywhere you have been before
Well hackers can lose and they can be detained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

[Hook]
One web, it’s a battleground
One web, and we're gonna smash it down
One web… One world

[Outro]
One web… One world
One web… One world
