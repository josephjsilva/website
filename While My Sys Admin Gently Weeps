In the style of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps"

I look at you all, see the server that’s sleeping
While my sys admin gently weeps
I look at the network and I see it needs scanning
While my sys admin gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to uninstall your apps
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold your access

I look at the server and I notice it's not turning on
While my sys admin gently weeps
With every mistake the AI makes we must surely be learning
Still my sys admin gently weeps

Well...

I don't know how you were deceived
You were privileged too
I don't know how you were so introverted 
No SIEM alerted you

I look at you all, why don’t you see the server there that's sleeping
I look from the racks at the server you were staging
While my sys admin gently weeps
Look at you all
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging while waiting for the updates to complete
Still my sys admin gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
